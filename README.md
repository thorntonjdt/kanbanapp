To run the app you will need node and npm installed - if you do, run the following in your console:
```
npm i
npm start
```
then point your browser to http://localhost:3000

This app requires an API for full functionality, go ahead and download mine in my kanbanapi repository. If you want to see how the react client handles server errors you can run the client without the API.
